His quivver is possibly depicted on the ground at his feet.

2007.10.2.242	gem cast	A tall and slender female figure carrying a bow and depicted with a stag, possibly identifying the figure as Artemis. The unusual dress might suggest that the gem showed an unknown female depicted as Artemis.

Her head is bowed slightly. In the centre of the foreground is a semi-circle which crosses the female figure\\'s left ankle or calf. It is unclear what this might represent. The second figure (to the right) is a smaller winged male facing to the left and the larger figure. He appears to be carrying a bow and stands under a tree. The two figures are almost certainly Aphrodite and Eros.	 
2007.10.2.254	gem cast	Bust of an older male figure in high relief. He has a philosopher\\'s beard and curly hair. His high forehead might indicate that he is balding. Clothing is evident draped over his left shoulder.

2007.10.2.294	gem cast	A young winged figure seated on the ground (probably Eros). The figure\\'s body is facing to the left while the head is turned back looking to the right. The figure is possibly looking at a stand to its right which has a complete set of armour placed upon it.	 
2007.10.2.295	gem cast	Naked male figure facing into the scene of the cast, his back to the \\'viewer\\'. The figure appears to be holding a staff which is mostly obscured behind his body.

Behind the bull, to the right of the cast, there is what appears to be a statue (possibly of female form) with two faces in profile, one facing left and the other right. The animal skin (if it is lion) perhaps identifies the male as Herakles. The scene might be a representation of one of Herakles tasks (yoking of the bulls).	 
2007.10.2.305	gem cast	A male figure stands over another figure, prostrate on the ground. The standing figure (probably male) is dressed in a cloak and tunic and holds a blade or scythe in his right hand. The standing figure appears to be holding the decapitated head of the second figure in his left hand. Behind the figure prostrate on the ground is an ox whose front legs are raised from the ground. To the right of the cast a tree or bush is depicted with a large bird (possibly a peacock) perched on one of its branches. At the centre of the cast there is what appears to be a standard or post with two serpents coiled about it. The serpent\\'s heads face each other at the top of the post.

A large serpent is coiled beneath the male figure and to the right a lyre is placed on a stand or podium. On the far right of the cast a second stand or podium is carved, this one has what appears to be a tripod standing upon it. To the far left of the cast stands a clothed female figure. She is holding a rod or staff. Her attention is not upon the central scene, she appears distracted by something which is occurring further left as her gaze is directed that way.	 
2007.10.2.307	gem cast	A bearded male figure crouches before a large handled urn. The urn is decorated with a simple line pattern. The figure appears to be holding a small hammer in his right hand, which he is possibly in the process of using (his gaze\\/concentration appears fixed upon it). To the far right of cast a tree is depicted, perhaps to simply denote the scene is an exterior one (rural rather than urban might also be suggested).	 
2007.10.2.308	gem cast	A large ox or bull is represented to the left and centre of the scene taking up most of the space within the cast. The beast\\'s head is turned as if it is looking towards the viewer. To the right a figure (probably male) is seated beneath a tree holding a staff. At the figure\\'s feet there appears to be a second (much smaller) creature.	 
2007.10.2.309	gem cast	Bust of a figure (male?) in profile facing right. The figure has long hair and wears a wreath (which type is not clear). He is dressed in a tunic which is fastened at the right shoulder, although the right side of the chest is revealed and appears quite muscular. There is some vague detail at both his back and chest. These appear to be a quivver and a bow, which would almost certainly identify the figure as Apollo.	 
2007.10.2.31	gem cast	Woman riding two horses with a whip	 
2007.10.2.310	gem cast	A bearded male crouches in front of a large handled urn. He appears to be holding a small hammer in his right hand which he is possibly using (gaze\\/concentration are directed towards it). The urn is decorated with what is possibly a sphynx. Very similar image to cast no.597.	 
2007.10.2.311	gem cast	A large female figure reclines in the centre of the scene. She is dressed in robes and is wearing either a helmet or a cap (Phyrigian cap?). Her left arm is resting on a disembodied (bearded male) head and her left hand holds a staff which rests against her upper-arm or shoulder. Beneath the large female figure and to the left of the male head are two shapes which possibly represent boats or ships. These shapes might indicate that the portion of the scene below the female figure is in fact a river or the sea. In turn this might suggest that the disembodied head is emerging from the water (possibly identifying it as a river god). To the left of the scene a very small figure appears to be presenting the large female figure with something, possibly a basket or urn. A slightly larger figure, leaning on a stick, looks on from beneath a tree. Above the very small figures head are two animals (presumably intended to appear to be further off in the background). One at least of these animals is certainly a horse. To the right of the large female figure\\'s head there is a representation of a stag. At the top of the scene in a central position are three shapes. It is unclear exactly what these are (possibly huts or houses of some description?).

45.10.22	Attic black figure amphora	a: The upper surface of the rim is reserved, although glazed. However, the side surfaces (internal and external) are black (apart from a reserved area that would not have been visible if the handle was not missing). The neck is also black on the inside, however, there is a perpetual motif of palmettes on the external surface. These are double palmettes (5 narrow divisions upwards and 5 similar ones downwards) that look as if chained together by a horizontal row of small rings and each such palmette is separated from the other by a vertical line with wider endings, while thin, curved lines (above and below) frame each palmette. The sides of the handle bear a black band each and there is also a thin line underneath them that contours the end of the neck. On the carination that divides the neck from the shoulder there is a thin line with added red colour. The shoulder bears a motif of tongues, divided by vertical lines, while a line underneath contours them. The motif does not appear under the surface of the handle. At some point underneath this pattern there is the beginning of another motif (black with 3 dots of added red and scale-like incisions). The interior of the rest of the vessel is reserved, since it is an amphora. b: It bears exactly the same motif as the previous neck bit. c: From the branch of a three-peaked floral motif there emerge two curved lines that are downwards and upwards, each forming an ellipsoid-shaped frame from whose lower (in the case of the curved line that goes downwrads) or upper (in the case of the other line) endings form one floral motif each. The left one is a voluted palmette with 5 petal shaped divisions and the right one is a three-pointed flower, similar to the central floral motif, but bigger. Although the upper part of this pattern is not preserved apart from the starting point of the motives, it is certain that this would have been the heraldic motif depicted. Underneath this area there is a thin, black line and below that, a pattern of guilloche ( branches with teardropped endings interwoven together) with a row of dots, framed (above and below) by two pairs of concentric lines. Towards the end of the fragment (which is also towards the end of the vessel) there is a radial-shaped motif, two lines and the rest of the surface is black. d: It is a part of the body\\'s area that bears the guilloche pattern and the radial-shaped motif underneath, but one third of it is not preserved. e: On the left there is the upper part of probably a palmette (two endings of petal-shaped divisions). Next to that there is the depiction of a draped lower body part. The drapery is formated by the incisions on a black surface. There are diagonal incisions and wavy endings to denote the folds of an himation, as well as the lower termination of the chiton, which is suggested by two almost horizontal incisions, a wavy line and another horizontal incision. the drawing is detailed and clear. f: The part between the surface above the knees and a bit below the calf of a male figure that wears a short chiton (incised, wavy folds are visible above the knee), as well as grieves with outcurving terminations (Hermes?) of added red colour, now fadded away. On his left there is the upper part of a palmette and on his left there is a diagonal line, with rows of dots on either side (characteric of Dionysus). Very clear drawing. g: Half of the three-peaked flower, a bit of a black line and two petal-shaped motives. On the side, there is part of the dotted branch and what appears to be part of a figure\\'s drapery (upper right body part ?), with some incisions used to render details. h: Between the lower body part of two figures there is part of the dotted branch. What is preserved from the right figure is incised lines and cirles on a black surface. The left figure\\'s drapery (peplos and himation ?) is preserved (below the waist), consisting of incised diagonal and wavy lines to denote the folds. i: A central male figure\\'s (Dionysos) body from shoulder to legs is visible and surrounded by a dotted branch. He is standing between two figures. The male figure (there is part of beard with added red) on the left holds part of the branch with his palm (upper body wihout the head is preserved). The only visible part of the draped figure on the right is part of the legs. Incisions are used to render details. j: Apollo playing his lyre (kithara). The head (in profile, facing right), right hand and part of the god\\'s front side of the body is visible, as well as the largest part of the lyre. Part of a dotted branch exists in the backgound. Incisions have been used to render the chords of the lyre as well as for the eye, contour of hair, ear and contour of the god\\'s body, while a taenia (fillet) on his head is in added black colour. k: Only part of a thin, black line is preserved. l: two broad black bands that overlap at some point. Incisions and the ending of a dotted branch (part of draped figure?).	Attic

A: Scene of a symposium of four, reclining, male figures; 2 men and 2 youths (in turns), in pairs looking at one another. All of them wear their himatia, loose around their waists, a fact that leaves the upper part of their bodies naked, and are crowned with identical three-pointed diadems, made of added, yellowish and white colour. They also have identical hairstyles. The youth on the left side makes a gesture, pointing left with his right hand, but facing the man on his right who touches his chest with his right hand. The third person looks as if holding a white thread with his right-hand fingers, while the man on his right is trying to put a white, spotted garland on the third figure with his right hand.  They all recline on a horizontal sort of bed, supported by three feet, of equal distance between them, but of unequal width. However, the lower parts of the three feet are similar; rectangular and vertical to the stem. Under this construction, in the surface between the two gaps that are left between the feet of the bed, there are two tables, that carry food(?) (fruit and bread ?), painted with added white colour. Both of the tables bear two, broad, black, bands around their edges, the left ones being larger than the right ones. As regards the endings of the tables\\' feet, they give the impression of a vague rendering of animal paws.\\nB: A youth in the centre of the scene looks at his right, while in either of his sides, another youth is looking at him. All of them are fully-clad with himatia. The left one is holding a strigil (stleggis) with his right hand, while the one at the right side of the scene makes a gesture with his feast.\\nThe spring of the handles bears part of a circle (it stops, leaving the surface between the beginning of the two handles undecorated), with small, semi-cercular patterns. Beneath each handle there is a large, complex palmette. A band with maeander-shaped patterns runs through the vessel under the main scenes.

E.23.2	Egyptian: Nubian or Kasnit believed to belong to a distinctive group made at a workshop in abydos in the 7th century bc. stele	Funerary stele with vulture wings surrounding the solar disk, common during the time period.  Below the wings is the text of the stele, surviving intact.  Two men are depicted adoring the god Re-Horakhty, whose presence is indicated not only by the uraeus and sun disk but also his name inscribed in the text.  It has been suggested that the dress of the figures indicates that they are Nubians; this is confirmed by the oddity of their personal names.  The sky is depicted above the winged disk, each end being supported by the symbol of the west (on the left, only the top of the feather survives) and the east (on the right, more or less complete).  A signature, possibly belonging to Flinders Petrie has been found above the head of the right hand figure.  \\n\\nThere is only one viable interpretation possible, when one combines the depictions with the details found within the text.  The stele depicts the man Serep and his son Tkr-Irt-Hrw, not as has been assumed Serep with his Ka.  A personal Ka has no need of the title m33 khrw, which is a title of the deceased, thus two deceased are depicted.  There is no question that Serep is a man as he is depicted in male dress and has the male symbol after his name.  \\n\\nThere is enough evidence to show that the stele was once painted.  Red pigment on the sun disk of the god is the most apparent, though a similar (if not the same) is found in several of the hieroglyphics and on the deceased as well as faint traces on the column to the right.  A yellow stain remains in the first two columns, which could be remains of the paint used to fill in the columns.  The combination of colours matches well with the red pigment found in the glyphs.

B: Satyr head, profile to left; tendrils in lower left and right fields; quarter palmette in upper left field; single palm leaf in upper right field.\\n\\nAlthough female heads are more popular in such contexts, the large red element in place of the ear is probably a horn and indicates that this is a representation of a satyr. The decoration in the lower left field of the B side indicates the addition of a second layer of black glaze, in a manner than changes the image (from a large tendril to a small tendril below  an L-shaped element.

TEMP.2003.8.1	black figure	(a)Part of the rim of an open jug of some sort.  The inside segment of the rim is painted black, with numerous small bits having been chipped off.  Moving outwards, the rim consists of the inside of the pot wall, which then splays out in a flat top rim, and then falls down again in a second wall that is left dangling from the outer rim.  So, moving from the inside outwards on the underside, there is a valley of about 1.0 wide and 1.5 deep until the top of the second rim (which is peaked) is reached.  The outward facing side of this downward pointed rim consists of alternating lines of black dots and thin black lines which run around the entire outer diameter of the rim.  There are two rows of dots and two lines, alternating which each other, all of which are heavily worn.  The top part of the rim, which would be facing upwards if the pot were complete, is about 2.2 wide and flat, marked with black raised lines that repeat about every .3 and which start at the outer edge and are 1.7 long, and painted black.  These lines are heavily worn.  There are also two significant chips in the top of this rim, each about 2 long.\\n(b)Another part of the same rim to the same vessel. The same dot and line pattern runs around the outer diameter. On top the lines which are thicker at the end pointing into the pot are repeated, a palmette decorates the larger flat area of the handle region.
